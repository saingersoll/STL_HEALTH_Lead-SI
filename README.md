### Abstract
This repository contains a map image of census tracts in St. Louis, Missouri, colored by the estimated number of high blood lead tests over the 2010-2015 period. The repository also contains a variety of plots describing high lead exposure in St. Louis and two demographic correlates - race and poverty.

Unlike adults, who tend to be exposed to lead in the workplace, childrens' exposures tend to be enviornmental through their homes or schools. The CDC's "level of concern" for a high test is [5 micrograms per deciliter](https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/lead/acclpp/lead_levels_in_children_fact_sheet.pdf) of lead in blood.

These data were obtained from Reuters' reporting on this topic. I use this map on the first day of class for introducing major themes, for teaching about race and health, and for discussing urban health issues.

## About SOC 1120: Introduction to Sociology - Diversity and Health Emphasis
### Course Description
Sociology is the empirical study of group and social life. Like all introductory courses, SOC 1120 provides an overview of the basic topics that sociologists regularly engage with under this broad definition. These include the theories used to hypothesize about the social world, the methods used to explore it, and the most common social phenomena we study. For each topic we discuss, specific examples from the sociology of medicine, the sociology of health and illness, and social epidemiology are used. The course meets Saint Louis University’s Cultural Diversity in the U.S. and Social Science core curriculum requirements. More details are available on the [course website](https://slu-soc1120.github.io).
